Notes:

NFA Decinteger beginning with 1:
Currently accepts integers in the form of 1_***_*_*. Need to ask if there is a requirement for the number of integers in between underscores.

NFA Decinteger beginning with 0:
Currently accepts 0_0***. Infinite number of trailing zeros. Need to make verify if this is correct.
